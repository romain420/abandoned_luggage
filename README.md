```
```bash
python ./detect.py --imgsz 640 # good results, very demanding on your computer
```
```bash
python ./detect.py --source video.mp4 # to analyze your own video, frame per frame, defaut is in 128p
```
```bash
python ./detect.py --imgsz 640 --source video.mp4 # best results by far, 640p, on your own video
```
